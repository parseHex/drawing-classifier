# `drawing-classifier`

An in-browser project to classify drawings, backed with the [data](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) gathered by Google's "[Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)". Mostly following the [Doodle Classifier](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zs14zKVuTuit6jApJgoYZQ) playlist by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).
